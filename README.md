# 7z crc cracker

Is a python script to recover plaintext of files based on their CRC32. Compressed files contains CRC32 (checksums) of the plaintext files. If the file is short enough, like 4 bytes, it is fairly easy to try all possible combinations to obtain the same CRC32 value.

I don't really think this is useful in a real world scenario, however this might be used in certain CTF challenges.
